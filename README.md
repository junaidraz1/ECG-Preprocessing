# ECG-Preprocessing
This project focuses on preprocessing and analyzing simultaneous ECG and PPG signals using standard Python libraries: NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas. The key steps include resampling signals, visualizing data in both time and frequency domains, and applying filters to enhance signal quality while preserving relevant information.
